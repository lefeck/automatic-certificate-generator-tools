# automatic-certificate-generator-tools
This is a self-issuing certificate tool that makes it very easy to issue certificates, All certificate formats can be generated.

## Requirements

The script  running Linux System

Utilities required:
> openssl

## Usage
```shell
[root@localhost ~]# ./automatic-certificate-generator-tools.sh  -h
Usage: automatic-certificate-generator-tools.sh [-a [rsa|ecc]] [-d <domain>] [-n <name>] [-t <days>] [-p <password>] [-s <show>] [-l <length>] [-C <country>] [-S <state>] [-L <local>] [-O <organization>] [-N <common_name>] [-h] [-v]"

💁 This script will be automatic certificate genetatory.


Available options:

-a --algorithm         Algorithms supported by the issuing certificate tool. for example: rsa, ecc, default the algorithm is "rsa".
-d --domain            The name of the domain name required to issue the certificate. for example: xxx.com, abc.org, *.abc.org, default the domain name is "domain.com".
-n --name              Name of the file generated by the issuance certificate, default the name is "server".
-t --days              Set the expiration time of the certificate, default the value is "3650" days.
-p --password          Set password for service certificate, default the password is random strings.
-s --show              Whether to display the service certificate password in the foreground, By default it will write to the .password file, if it is true it will output
                       the plaintext password in the foreground.
-l --length            Set password of the length, default the password length is 8 digits, This parameter and the -p option cannot be used together.
-h --help              Print this help and exit
-v --verbose           Print script debug info
```
## example
You need to specify different parameters, the execution process requires you to enter the certificate password to encrypt the certificate. 
```shell
[root@localhost ~]# ./automatic-certificate-generator-tools.sh -a ecc -t 365000

``` 
This method is recommended, because it can hide secrets.


The default servver certificate password will not be displayed in the foreground, if you want to display the output, you need to specify the -s parameter. for example:

```shell
[root@localhost ~]# ./automatic-certificate-generator-tools.sh -a ecc -t 365000 -s
